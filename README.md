# Wikidata-based-multilingual-library-search
Project from the 4th Swiss Open Cultural Data Hackathon in Zurich 2018 

![Poster](Swissbib-Poster-Low-Res.jpg)

In Switzerland each linguistic region is working with different authority files for authors and organizations, situation which brings difficulties for the end user when he is doing a search. 

Goal of the Hackathon: work on a innovative solution as the library landscape search platforms will change in next years. Possible solution: Multilingual Entity File which links to GND, BnF, ICCU Authority files and Wikidata to bring end user information about authors in the language he wants.
